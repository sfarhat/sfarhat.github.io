					<div>My name is Sean Farhat and I am currently an undergraduate student
					at the University of California, Berkeley, studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and planning to graduate in the spring of 2020. At the moment, I am pursing my interest in modelling phenomena by taking courses in artifical intelligence,
					robotics, and cognitive neuroscience as well as doing research in machine learning and microrobotics. In addition,
					I teach the introductory computer architecture course, CS 61C, as a uGSI. Below, you can find more information about the work
					I've done as well as information on how to <a href="#contact">contact</a> me if you wish.</div>

				I currently work in the SWARM Lab under Professor Kristofer Pister and graduate student Nathan Lambert on a project investigating self-driving microrobots. As of now, before moving to the tiny scale of a robotic bug, we are working on creating an end-to-end system for an RC car. Progress so far has comprised of utilizing various computer vision algorithms like Canny Edge detection to create binary masks on an image, which, when passed into several filtering algorithms and a PID controller, will compute a desired trajectory. This solution has been partially effective, as shown below:

				Looking forward, we are currently working on replacing the previous filter system by investigating low power convolutional neural networks and transfer learning. Progress on the project can be found at this <a href = "https://github.com/sfarhat/donkey-car-controller/">Github repository</a>.
